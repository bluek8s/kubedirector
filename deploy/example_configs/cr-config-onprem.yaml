# This is an example of a KubeDirector global configuration object that may
# be suitable for a local K8s installation on RHEL or CentOS. It sets the
# service type to NodePort, assuming that LoadBalancer services are not
# available. It also sets nativeSystemdSupport to true as this is the correct
# value for RHEL/CentOS systems with OS version 7.2 or later.
