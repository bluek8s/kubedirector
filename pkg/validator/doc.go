// Package validator handles dynamic admission control checks for resources.
//
// InitValidationServer and StartValidationServer are called from the main
// function of KubeDirector. This starts an independent webserver process to
// field validation requests. Then, when resources in kubedirector.bluedata.io
// (KubeDirectorCluster and KubeDirectorApp) are created/changed/deleted,
// the validation function will be invoked to check the proposed operation.
